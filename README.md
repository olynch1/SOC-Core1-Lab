- ✅ Explored ICMP filtering and UFW troubleshooting
- ✅ Practiced cross-platform network testing

## Tools

- Kali Linux
- ifconfig / ip
- ping
- UFW
- Git

## Next Steps

- [ ] Run Nmap scans from Kali → Mac
- [ ] Log traffic with Wireshark or tcpdump
- [ ] Push lab notes and results to GitHub regularly
